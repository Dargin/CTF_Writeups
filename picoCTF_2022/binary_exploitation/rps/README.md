Time to play some rock, paper, scissors! Download the file attached to the challenge and lets take a look. First thing we notice is the flag is again defined within the application, there are two arrays [hands and loses] that relate to the game, and a variable to track our wins.

So we know we need to win the game five times in a row. Lets take a look at main. We see that we're asked if we want to play, the play function is used and if it returns true (win) then the win count is incremented, but if we lose the win count goes back to zero and if win is greather than or equal to 5 we get the flag.

So now lets take a look at the play function as nothing in here looks particularly useful. So we input a string, then the computer selects it's play using rand(), then a strstr is used to see if what we entered matches what would be needed for the computer to lose. If we look up at the variables we see that "loses" means the computer loses, for example in hands[0] is rock and in loses[0] is paper. The issue here is that strstr isn't an exact match, more it checks to see if a value exists within a string.

So if we give the game rockpaperscissors then every time we'll have a match! Do this five times to print the flag.
