In this challenge we are given a document (.docm). With a docm that means there is a macro; so lets look at that in libre-office. When you open the macro you'll see a bunch of gibberish. I took a very lazy approach to this; marked the variables i thought were intresting as watchers with the eyeglass button, then put break points at various parts of the code to see what the values came to. I was having issues copying the value out of the track window so i eneded up just putting in the command.

```

```

after the variable was fully created - this is a base64 string. Decode it and get your string!
